His days at KIIT were a blend of classroom learning, late-night study sessions, and the camaraderie that comes with being part of a diverse and dynamic student community.
            
            Ritesh quickly found his niche among a group of friends who shared his enthusiasm for learning and exploration. Together, they navigated through the intricacies of their courses, turning challenges into opportunities for mutual growth. The campus, with its modern facilities and bustling activity, became a second home for Ritesh and his companions.
